## What is e2?
It is a nXm square-tile puzzle solver. Currently it attempts to solve the boarder and in a clockwise path, (starting in the top left) and spirals into the middle.
It has one trick, (pre-sorting the tiles) and other than that, it is a bruit-force search.

## Why name is e2?
 The name is deliberately short to make it ungoogleable. (I don't want shiny new rustaceans wandering in here and learning bad habits.)
